Asteroids_Vala
==============

Simple game using OpenGL

What´s this ?
-------------

An test of the darkcore lib . Darkcore uses opengl to display sprite.

The move the 'ship' with arrows , the ship rotates slowly, fire with space.

If you hit all rock´s , the game ends. 

Still 2 bugs:

Game Over Text is not displayd!

Crashs sometimes when ship is hit by rock.(Must rewrite detection )

Missing animation( of explosion etc ..).
